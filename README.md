# PAYROLL-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

The database our team has developed tries to tackle the problem of vehicle passenger management of a transport service company, where we provided the database with the passenger's account details, the vehicle details, and transaction details with separate tables for each property. 
We use different database management concepts to achieve a good database to satisfy all needs and make it understandable to a layman. With proper table names and labels. 
The application also has a special feature to view some important data directly with one click, and automatic checks to ensure the data entered is valid.
